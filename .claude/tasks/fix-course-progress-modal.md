# Fix Course Progress Modal - Implementation Plan

## Problem Analysis

The course progress modal shows 0/2 lessons completed despite all activities being completed because:

1. **Missing Auto-Completion Trigger**: When assignments are submitted, the system doesn't call `checkAndAutoCompleteLesson()` to check if the lesson should be marked as complete.

2. **Current Auto-Completion Triggers**:
   - ✅ Content completion triggers auto-check (via `ProgressService.markContentComplete()`)
   - ✅ Exam submission triggers auto-check (via `ExamController.submitExam()`)
   - ❌ Assignment submission does NOT trigger auto-check

## Root Cause

In `AssignmentController.submitAssignment()` method, after an assignment is submitted, the system doesn't check if this completes all lesson requirements and should auto-complete the lesson.

## Solution Architecture

### Fix 1: Add Auto-Completion Check to Assignment Submission
**File**: `backend/src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/AssignmentController.java`
- After successful assignment submission, call `lessonCompletionService.checkAndAutoCompleteLesson()`
- This will check if all lesson requirements are met and auto-mark the lesson as complete

### Fix 2: Update Progress Calculation After Auto-Completion
**File**: `backend/src/main/java/com/example/demo/service/AssignmentService.java`
- Ensure progress is recalculated after assignment submission
- Return updated progress information

## Implementation Steps

1. **Modify AssignmentController.submitAssignment()**
   - Add dependency injection for `LessonCompletionService`
   - After submission, call `checkAndAutoCompleteLesson()`
   - Similar to how it's done in `ExamController`

2. **Test the Fix**
   - Submit an assignment for a lesson with all content viewed and exam completed
   - Verify lesson is auto-marked as complete
   - Check that progress modal shows correct lesson count (e.g., 1/2 or 2/2)

## Code Changes Required

### AssignmentController.java
```java
// Add dependency
private final LessonCompletionService lessonCompletionService;

// Update constructor
public AssignmentController(..., LessonCompletionService lessonCompletionService) {
    // ... existing assignments
    this.lessonCompletionService = lessonCompletionService;
}

// In submitAssignment method, after submission:
@PostMapping("/{assignmentId}/submit")
public ResponseEntity<AssignmentSubmissionDTO> submitAssignment(...) {
    User student = userService.findByUsername(authentication.getName());
    AssignmentSubmission submission = assignmentService.submitAssignment(assignmentId, student, file, comment);

    // NEW: Check if lesson should be auto-completed
    Assignment assignment = assignmentService.getAssignmentById(assignmentId);
    if (assignment.getLesson() != null) {
        lessonCompletionService.checkAndAutoCompleteLesson(student, assignment.getLesson());
    }

    return ResponseEntity.ok(dtoMapperService.mapToAssignmentSubmissionDTO(submission));
}
```

## Expected Outcome

After implementing this fix:
1. When a student completes all activities in a lesson (content, exam, assignments)
2. The lesson will be automatically marked as complete
3. The progress modal will show the correct lesson completion count (e.g., "1/2" instead of "0/2")
4. The overall course progress percentage will be accurately calculated

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Complete all content in a lesson
- [ ] Pass the exam in the lesson
- [ ] Submit all assignments in the lesson
- [ ] Verify lesson is auto-marked as complete
- [ ] Check progress modal shows correct lesson count
- [ ] Verify progress percentage is correct

## Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Manual Lesson Completion Button**: Rejected - Less user-friendly, requires extra user action
2. **Batch Progress Recalculation**: Rejected - Inefficient, doesn't provide real-time updates
3. **Frontend-only Fix**: Rejected - Would create data inconsistency between frontend and backend

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: The fix follows existing patterns (exam submission already does this)
- **No Breaking Changes**: Only adds missing functionality, doesn't change existing behavior
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal - only adds one database check per assignment submission
